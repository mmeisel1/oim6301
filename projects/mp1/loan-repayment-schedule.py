    # Mini Project 1

    Your choice of option, what each one asks for, the due date and how it is graded are on the Mini Project 1 page of the course site, linked from the calendar. This notebook is the shape to build it in. Keep the headings, and replace each line in italics with your own.

    Save it in your course repository as `projects/mp1/<your-tool>.py`, named for what it does, such as `loan-schedule.py`, and open it with `uv run marimo edit`.

That helps them decide whether a lower monthly payment is worth paying more interest over the life of the loan.

    - *What does your loop carry from one step to the next, the way a running total carries its sum?*
    - *Which check will you use in section 6, and which two numbers should agree?*

    *Commit this notebook with the message `mp1: plan before AI`.*

    Every number the project starts from goes in the cell below, and nowhere else, so that changing one input changes every result after it.

    Copy in the default inputs for your option from the Mini Project 1 page. If you chose D, your own option, type your data in here, or ask your agent to generate it with `faker`. The required part reads no file.
